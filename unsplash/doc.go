/*
Package unsplash provides a RESTful go binding for https//:unsplash.com API.

# Usage

Use the following import path:

	import "github.com/hbagdi/go-unsplash/unsplash"

# Authentication

Authentication is not handled by directly by go-unsplash.
Instead, pass an http.Client
that can handle authentication for you.
You can use libraries such as https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/oauth2.
Please note that all calls will include the OAuth token and hence, http.Client
should not be shared between users.
Note that if you're just using actions that require the public permission scope,
only the AppID is required.

# Creating an instance

An instance of unsplash can be created using New().
The http.Client supplied will be used to make requests to the API.

	ts := oauth2.StaticTokenSource(
	  &oauth2.Token{AccessToken: "Your-access-token"},
	)
	client := oauth2.NewClient(oauth2.NoContext, ts)
	//use the http.Client to instantiate unsplash
	unsplash := unsplash.New(client)
	// requests can be now made to the API
	randomPhoto, _ , err := unsplash.RandomPhoto(nil)

# Error handling

All API calls return an error as second or third return object.
All successful calls will return nil in place of this return.
Further, go-unsplash has errors defined as types for better error handling.

	randomPhoto, _ , err := unsplash.RandomPhoto(nil)
	if err != nil {
	  //handle error
	}

# Pagination

Pagination is supported by supplying a page
number in the ListOpt.
The NextPage field in Response can be used to  get the next page number.

	var allPhotos []*unsplash.Photo
	searchOpt := &unsplash.SearchOpt{Query: "Batman"}
	for {
		photos, resp, err := unsplash.Search.Photos(searchOpt)

		if err != nil {
			return
		}

		allPhotos = append(allPhotos, photos)

		if !resp.HasNextPage {
			break
		}
		searchOpt.Page = resp.NextPage
	}
